        <p>We will have a look at a <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestProject</code> to get an idea of how jenkins can be used to build, sign and deploy iOS projects. The whole process consists of 4 steps. Note that to deploy an app in this manner, an enterprise distribution certificate is required for each app.
This guide is how I have set up my enterprise builds for my apps that use <code class="highlighter-rouge">cocoaPods</code> for dependencies, but most of the same principles apply for any iOS apps.
Because the project uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">cocoaPods</code>, it means we have to build a workspace and have a build scheme set up.</p>

        <p>It is pretty rare to actually have to dive into the objc-runtime for any day to day coding. Most developers wont have to touch the runtime, however it is helpful to know what is possible and be able to use it if required. The objective-c runtime is written in C and is how the underlying parts of the objective-c language work including message sending, ivars and properties. This post shows an example of where I have used the Objective-C runtime in one of my projects.</p>

        <p>D*Lite is an incremental heuristic search algorithm that is used by agents (game ai, or robots) where the surrounding terrain is not completely known. The algorithm makes assumptions about the unknown terrain. D*Lite finds the shortest route from the start to the goal position, and as it encounters new obstacles these are taken into account and only part of the path is modified. Alternatively, pathfinding algorithms like A* typically have to replan the entire path when the environment changes.</p>

        <p>I am starting to learn XNA at the moment, so I am doing what everyone does when they learn a new language - remake their favourite game! I am making a simple remake of the windows version of Chips Challenge using the sprites from the open source clone of the game which can be found here - <a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tworld/">http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tworld/</a> . Although this remake is by no means a full remake or compatible with the original, I am posting the source code so that someone else can learn from this experience. Keep in mind that this is my first game in XNA, so the code is a bit sloppy but it works.</p>

        <p>I have been working on displaying the dark matter from the HDF5 data sets that I have been working on for my astronomy work. Over the last couple of days, I got the loading from HDF5 working and the translation into my local coordinates. The volume is changed from point coordinates to voxel coordinates, then scaled and clamped to the bounding box size. This has to be done because the camera slowly zooms in over the course of the animation and some of the gas / dark matter can leave the simulation.</p>

        <p>Just a quick update on what I have been working on. One of the first posts on this blog was a terrain viewer. That project was thrown together very quickly for a weekly assessment, so it wasn’t coded very well and was exceptionally bloated for what it did. I have had some spare time, so I started a fresh and commenced building a minimal terrain loader from the ground up. So far, I have terrain loading from file (generated with the tool in previous posts), and displaying a texture mapped, shadowed terrain using glDrawElements. I have specifically not included loading from heightmap in this project because it is easier to load a point struct from a binary file, but heightmap loading could be added in easily and probably will be in the coming days / weeks.</p>

        <p>The terrain generated in the last post was quite bumpy, what if I want smooth rolling hills or something that isn’t quite so bumpy. There are two options here - you can either play around with the diamond-square weights and method of generating the terrain or you can smooth the result. The method I have chosen is a mean (average) filter also known as a box filter. The filter works by moving a square (say 3x3) across the terrain values taking the average of the pixels surrounding it to give the center value an averaged result.</p>
