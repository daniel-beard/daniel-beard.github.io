  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately I have been really enjoying a game called Minecraft. It&rsquo;s an indie game made by one guy, I highly recommend it!</p>

<p>I have ported the heightmap generation code in one of my earlier posts to C# and using XNA I have been creating a minecraft style rendering for fun. My first approach was a brute force, render everything test. As you might have guessed, that didn&rsquo;t turn out so well when rendering a decent sized terrain. The method I am using now is hardware instancing without any kind of occlusion culling at the moment. I am getting a decent frame rate (about 80fps for 20000 models) for the moment and I am going to continue on improving this method. The example that is linked at the bottom of this article shows how to perform hardware, and shader instancing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of it in action:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am starting to learn XNA at the moment, so I am doing what everyone does when they learn a new language - remake their favourite game! I am making a simple remake of the windows version of Chips Challenge using the sprites from the open source clone of the game which can be found here - <a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tworld/">http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tworld/</a> . Although this remake is by no means a full remake or compatible with the original, I am posting the source code so that someone else can learn from this experience. Keep in mind that this is my first game in XNA, so the code is a bit sloppy but it works.</p>

<p>Some of the features that I implemented for this tile based game are level saving and loading, an advanced menu system, power ups, a timer class, event handling and game state management. This remake is a simple one layer approach, as opposed to the original two layer version. I am implementing features as I go along and have finished the first level and I am working on the next levels. Progress might go a bit faster after I create a level editor, because hand coding levels is no fun! The core functionality of this game was completed in a day as a programming challenge that I set myself. The extra features / tiles took an extra day of coding (that I put off for far too long). At the moment, the code is quite messy, there are a few ugly hacks (especially the input detection), but I am working on improving it, adding a full input manager and possibly some enemies that move etc.</p>

<p>In the future I am looking at uploading more games that I can prototype quickly (for programming practice). So look forward to other classic remakes and newer stuff as well.</p>

<p>Here is a screen shot.</p>

<p><a href="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/chipsgamescreenshot.png"><img src="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/chipsgamescreenshot.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>For people that are thinking of creating a tile based game, I suggest taking the time to make it work with the Tiled Map Editor level format. The Tiled Map Editor is a quick and easy way for creating tiled based levels (square and isometric). The tiles can have attributes associated with them which makes the code to load and save levels much cleaner. Wish I had used Tiled!</p>

<p>So check out the source code for this game and give it a bit of a play!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>ScienceWA has run a story about my work and my supervisor! First published science magazine article!</p>

<p>They also bring up the upcoming planetarium show, so I guess now that it&rsquo;s in writing that I should get a move on and finish my parts for it. The show will focus mostly on the creation and evolution of the galaxy showing how the hydrogen gas changes shape over time and how dark matter interacts with it. There is also going to be a fly-through of the 6DF galaxies and a 360 degree interview with Alan Duffy. We are trying to get a 3d fly-through of a similar galaxy to this one:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Often I find the need to play two videos side by side without borders or separate windows. Until now, I have been converting two videos into a single video which takes forever.</p>

<p>So I wrote a simple little cocoa OSX app to load up and play two videos side by side. It doesn&rsquo;t have heaps of features, but it does exactly what I need so I am posting this incase anyone else could use it.</p>

<p>This application uses QTkit to play videos so the file size is tiny. (Only 57KB!)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been working on displaying the dark matter from the HDF5 data sets that I have been working on for my astronomy work. Over the last couple of days, I got the loading from HDF5 working and the translation into my local coordinates. The volume is changed from point coordinates to voxel coordinates, then scaled and clamped to the bounding box size. This has to be done because the camera slowly zooms in over the course of the animation and some of the gas / dark matter can leave the simulation.</p>

<p>The first result was encouraging, but wasn&rsquo;t what I expected. In the following image, the green points is the dark matter volume displayed in Drishti.</p>

<p><a href="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/darkmatter_001.png"><img src="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/darkmatter_001.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The problem was that Drishti sucks at displaying dynamic range. The internal possible range of values is limited to the size of an unsigned char (0-255). While this would limit the memory usage, I wish there was an option to use short int, or even float because in the image above, all the dark matter points are physically there but the dynamic range is too high to accurately display them. This may have implications on how my other volumes are being displayed as well. I realised that dark matter for this simulation doesn&rsquo;t have a mass associated with it and doesn&rsquo;t share mass between voxels either. To check that the points were actually there, I fired up stereo2 and took an image of the raw points.</p>

<p><a href="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/darkmatterpoints.png"><img src="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/darkmatterpoints.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>So the points are there, my code and Drishti just weren&rsquo;t displaying them properly. I fixed the dynamic range issue by setting voxels that contained dark matter points to 1. The end result is shown below, and what is expected. Hopefully I can get some awesome movies going with the dark matter as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick update on what I have been working on. One of the first posts on this blog was a terrain viewer. That project was thrown together very quickly for a weekly assessment, so it wasn&rsquo;t coded very well and was exceptionally bloated for what it did. I have had some spare time, so I started a fresh and commenced building a minimal terrain loader from the ground up. So far, I have terrain loading from file (generated with the tool in previous posts), and displaying a texture mapped, shadowed terrain using glDrawElements. I have specifically not included loading from heightmap in this project because it is easier to load a point struct from a binary file, but heightmap loading could be added in easily and probably will be in the coming days / weeks.</p>

<p>The code is written using OpenGL and the openFrameworks toolkit. OpenFrameworks is used for loading the textures and setting up a window, etc. The size of the file is surprisingly small, just a few hundred lines. I thought I would upload this before I changed everything to a class and added some level of detail stuff to it. So here is a picture showing the pretty terrain.</p>

<p><a href="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/shadowedterrain.png"><img src="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/shadowedterrain.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I have heaps more work to do on this subject, but for now here is the source code.
Just drop this into your openFrameworks project (or use with openGL and load your own images).
The zip file also contains the terrain and the texture.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The terrain generated in the last post was quite bumpy, what if I want smooth rolling hills or something that isn&rsquo;t quite so bumpy. There are two options here - you can either play around with the diamond-square weights and method of generating the terrain or you can smooth the result. The method I have chosen is a mean (average) filter also known as a box filter. The filter works by moving a square (say 3x3) across the terrain values taking the average of the pixels surrounding it to give the center value an averaged result.</p>

<p>The box filter size is usually a power of 2 + 1. Some examples are 3x3, 5x5, 9x9, etc. The image below shows how the filter works. The 3x3 square is slid over the terrain averaging it&rsquo;s neighbours. The center pixel is also taken into account.</p>

<p><a href="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/filter.png"><img src="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/filter.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Ok, time for some source code. The following code loops over the 2d array of pixels, the inner loop loops from the position minus the filter size to the position plus the filter size in each dimension, this allows us to have an arbitrary filter size without hand coding the weights and positions of each pixel in the filter. The count variable keeps track of how many points contribute to the average and we ignore edge cases meaning that if a point in the filter is outside the array, it gives no contribution to the average.</p>

<p><a href="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/code.png"><img src="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/code.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>So the results for running this on the terrain in the previous post are as follows first with no smoothing, then with a box size of 9x9:</p>

<p><a href="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/terrain-simple.png"><img src="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/terrain-simple.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>And of course the smoothing can be iterated over many times. Here is the same filter size as above, but repeated 50 times.</p>

<p><a href="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/really-smooth.png"><img src="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/really-smooth.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have posted previously about a simple terrain heightmap display program I have made, but never talked about some of the methods of generating and manipulating heightmap based terrain systems.</p>

<p>The method I have implemented in my terrain generation program is known as the Diamond-Square algorithm and is a method of procedural terrain generation. The Diamond-Square algorithm is also known as random midpoint displacement fractal, cloud fractal or the plasma fractal.</p>

<p>We start with a 2D array of size (n<sup>2</sup> + 1) E.g. 257, 513 etc. Set the four corners to initial values, these can be random or preset it doesn&rsquo;t really matter too much at this point.</p>

<p>We then perform the diamond step which consists of taking the four points arranged in a square shape, averaging the four values and adding a random value to the average, creating diamond shapes. The square step then averages the four corners of the diamonds created in the previous step. The center value of this step becomes the corners of the next step. The diamond and square step are repeated until all the points in the grid have values assigned to them.</p>

<p><a href="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/diamond-square-algorithm.png"><img src="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/diamond-square-algorithm.png" alt="" /></a>The image above shows the alternating steps being carried out. The red dots are the pixels with new values, the black dots are pixels with existing values. The pseudocode from gameprogrammer.com is as follows:</p>

<pre><code> While the length of the side of the squares
 is greater than zero {
 Pass through the array and perform the diamond
 step for each square present.
 Pass through the array and perform the square
 step for each diamond present.
 Reduce the random number range.
 } (GameProgrammer.com)
</code></pre>

<p>Then we end up with a program that can generate terrain / cloud maps / general fractal noise. Below is an example image that I have generated at 512x512.</p>

<p><a href="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/terrain.png"><img src="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/terrain.png?w=300" alt="Heightmap 512x512" /></a></p>

<p>Below is a sample of what the terrain looks like with simple shading in OpenGL without textures. The shading effect is calculated by giving a colour based on the minimum and maximum values of the heightmap. E.g. VertexColour = (value - minY) / (maxY - minY);</p>

<p><a href="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/terrain-simple.png"><img src="http://danielbeard.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/terrain-simple.png?w=300" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I find that the easiest way to import data from my terrain generation program into the display program is to use the built-in IO functions to create an easy to read file format. The advantage of using this method is that you can store heights as floating point values instead of bytes (0-255) this gives many more possible heights, a greater dynamic range. The code to write these files is quite simple:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span style="color:#0000ff;"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; SaveTerrFile(){
        &lt;span style="color:#999999;"&gt;//Write to file&lt;/span&gt;
        FILE *fp;
        fp = fopen(&lt;span style="color:#339966;"&gt;"terrain.terr"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:#339966;"&gt;"wb"&lt;/span&gt;);

        &lt;span style="color:#999999;"&gt;//print out the data&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style="color:#3366ff;"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color:#ff9900;"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; x=0; x &lt; DATA_SIZE-&lt;span style="color:#ff9900;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;; x++){
            &lt;span style="color:#3366ff;"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style="color:#ff9900;"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; y=0; y &lt; DATA_SIZE-&lt;span style="color:#ff9900;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;; y++){
                  &lt;span style="color:#999999;"&gt;//populate the point struct&lt;/span&gt;

<p>Other features that I think need to be added to this code is the ability to generate textures as well based on the height values, smoothing of the terrain and improvements to the viewer. For now though, here is some source code. This code saves the height values to a file. I haven&rsquo;t included any image saving functionality in this version because I am not sure of the licensing issues that may arise. Will find out soon, more updates to this coming in the next couple of days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I added anti-aliasing to the rendering of the ray tracer. At first I tried regular sampling which is breaking a pixel down into smaller sub-pixels and shooting rays through the center of those pixels and averaging the result. This was better than nothing but still created some artifacts when rendering. The next trial was random sampling to replace aliasing with noise, but the samples can become clumped together and look unnatural. The method that I have settled on for now is jittered sampling which consists of breaking the target pixel down into sub-pixels and shooting rays at a random position through the sub-pixels so that each sub-pixels has at least one ray shot through it. Changing the amount of samples per pixel reduces the aliasing effect.</p>

<p>This type of anti-aliasing is hard coded into the display function. In the next week I am going to abstract this process away so that different methods of anti-aliasing can be used without changing lots of code.</p>

<p>The image that is attached is rendered with jittered sampling with 64 samples per pixel.</p>
